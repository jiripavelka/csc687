 * Paper: [Comprehensive Mapping of Long-Range Interactions Reveals Folding Principles of the Human Genome][1]
 * By George J. Pavelka on March 11th, 2020

The paper describes a new method called Hi-C to map 3D architecture of whole genoms. Illustrated on human genome by coupling DNA sequences that are close to each other constructing spacial proximity maps (heat maps) at a resolution of 1 megabase. Being able to show areas of chromosomes and give aproximation of small chromosomes that are rich on genes.
