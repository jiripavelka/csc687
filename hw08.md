 * By George J. Pavelka on April 9, 2020

The problem was to predict a secondary protein structure in a powerful way with a reasonable accuracy. For that a two-stage neural network has been used based on position specific scoring matrices generated by PSI-BLAST.

According to benchmark (below) the presented method clearly beat other known methods including the popular PHD method evaluated by stringent blind testing. Using a testing set of 187 folds with three-way cross-validation criteria the presented method PSIPRED achieved an average Q3 score between 76.5 % and 78.3 %.

## Method Stages

The prediction method has been divided into three stages: generating profile sequence, neural network architecture processing predicting the initial secondary structure and finally filtering of that structure into the resulting structure.

### Stage 1: Generation of sequence profiles

Since standard approaches to generate sequence profiles are cumbersome and time-consuming, a very powerful method of PSI-BLAST has been used. To use the generated matrix as an input for neural network (below), a final position-specific scoring matrix must be derived from it in three iterations.

1. To get the scoring matrix, PSI-BLAST was compiled with the debug flag in the POSIT module. Thanks to it we can simply parse the matrix from its log file.
2. For every value compute the probability of that residue substitution at given place in template. That is being averaged by BLOSUM62 matrix score at the corresponding place.
3. Resulting values (in range of plus/minus seven) were normalized between zero and one using the standard logistic function 1 / (1 + e^-x).

### Stage 2: Neural network architecture

For the sake of PSIPRED a standard feed-forward back-propagation network architecture has been used. It used one hidden layer. Different setups were tested on 16 prediction targets from the second CASP experiment as a benchmark.

With an overall Q3 score above 80 % a window of 15 amino acid residues showed optimal results. Therefore, the input layer had 315 units as 15 times 21. Additionally, to the 20 amino acids there is an extra unit with values N or C showing where the given window spans.

In order to get rid of successive outputs from the first neural network, a second network was introduced. Its input layer had only 60 input units as 15 times four. Three values are the output from the first network and the additional input indicates weather the current window spans a chain terminus.

### Stage 3: Neural network training

A standard procedure of back-propagation training was used to set up the weight function in the network. It has been trained with respect to the momentum term to prevent oscillation. 

Over-training paradigm has been prevented by evaluating against 10 % of the training set that was not used for direct training. The network has been trained until the performance on the set started to degrade.

## Evaluation procedure

To prevent overly favorable results a very thorough cross-validation experiment has been used. Therefore, a testing set of data has been separated from the training set before training. To make the cross-validation reliable they removed protein with similar fold to any member of testing set.

To obtain sets for the sake of training and testing, every protein has been evaluated with respect to the CATH classifications for their constituent domains. They excluded proteins having domain fold in common with any of the domains found in the test set.

They derived the secondary structure states (helix, strand and coil) from definition produced by DSSP by reducing eight states (H, I, G, E, B, S T, --) to above mentioned three states. The reduction considered H and I to be helix states, E and B are considered strand states and other states were considered to be coil.

## Evaluation results

The evaluation has been done as a distribution of Q3 scores and Sov3 scores for the set of 187 protein chains. The average Q3 score was 76 % with a standard deviation of 7.8 %. The average Sov3 score was 73.5 % with a standard deviation of 12.7 %.

The results indicate that the described method is very top of the range of accuracies documented for secondary structure prediction methods.
